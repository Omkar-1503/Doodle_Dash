# Doodle Dash

A real-time, multiplayer drawing and guessing game built using Node.js, Socket.IO, React, and TypeScript. Players join rooms, take turns drawing prompts, and compete to guess the drawings in a fun and interactive environment. With real-time canvas synchronization, timeouts for word selection, and smooth drawing experiences, this project captures the excitement of collaborative gameplay.

## Backend

The backend is developed using Node.js and Socket.IO. It handles real-time communication between clients and the server.

### Server Events

- **Client Events:**
  - `connect` - Client connects to the server.
  - `disconnecting` - Client disconnects from the server.
  - `joinRoom` - Client joins a room.
  - `leaveRoom` - Client leaves a room.
  - `startGame` - Client starts the game.
  - `draw` - Client sends drawing data.
  - `guess` - Client sends a guess.
  - `changeSettings` - Client changes game settings.
  - `wordSelect` - Client selects a word.

- **Server Events:**
  - `joinedRoom` - Server confirms client has joined the room.
  - `playerJoined` - Server notifies when a player joins.
  - `playerLeft` - Server notifies when a player leaves.
  - `gameStarted` - Server notifies when the game starts.
  - `gameEnded` - Server notifies when the game ends.
  - `drawData` - Server sends drawing data to clients.
  - `guessed` - Server notifies when a word is guessed.
  - `turnEnded` - Server notifies when a turn ends.
  - `chooseWord` - Server requests the drawer to choose a word.
  - `wordChosen` - Server sends the chosen word to clients.
  - `settingsChanged` - Server notifies when settings are changed.
  - `guessFail` - Server notifies when a guess fails.

### Room System

Players join a room using a unique room ID. If the drawer takes too long to choose a word, one is automatically assigned. Each turn has a time limit for guessing.

## Frontend

The frontend is developed using React with TypeScript and Vite for a fast development experience.
